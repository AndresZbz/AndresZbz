### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan, a CS student currently doing webdev things but this github is mostly focused (kinda) into game dev stuff.

Programming languages I mostly use:
- JavaScript
- Python
- C#

Frameworks/libraries/whatever things I use (for both webdev & gamedev)

- React
- Vue
- Monogame
- SDL2
